# Koa Reddit Clone

In an attempt to get back to adding more to my Github as well as trying familiarize myself with Koa, I have decided to make a reddit clone.  

This will be followed by a front end built with either Next.js or Vue.js (Not sure which).

    npm install
    npm start

## Stack so far

 - Koa (With various middlewares)
 - MongoDB (Mongoose)
 - Auth (JWT/bcrypt)
