# Koa Reddit Clone

In an attempt to familiarize myself with Koa, I have decided to make a reddit clone.  This will be followed by a front end built with either Next.js or Vue.js(Not sure which).

    npm install
    npm start

## Stack so far
 - Koa (With various middlewares)
 - MongoDB (Mongoose)
 - Auth (JWT/bcrypt)
